 * <p>Provides classes necessary to hold the state of aggregate and analytic
 * processing.  This includes the value classes <code>AggregateValue</code> and
 * <code>AnalyticValue</code> that hold the results of aggregate and analytic
 * operations, respectively.  These classes may have existed prior to 0.9.0,
 * but they were organized into this package for 0.9.0.</p>
